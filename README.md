# ThRandomizer

A WIP and fairly basic randomizer for Touhou games. As of right now, it only supports randomizing ECL instruction parameters, but will include more file formats in the future.

---

Current features:
* Bullet data randomization (Colors, speed, amounts, complex patterns, etc)
* Difficulty flag randomization **This breaks a lot of things and probably will crash**

Currently supported games:
* Touhou 13 - Ten Desires to Touhou 17 - Wily Beast and Weakest Creature

---

Planned features:
* A better UI
* Entity randomization
* Timer/Wait instruction randomization (Maybe, if it doesn't break everything)
* (Possibly) stage background randomization
* DAT archive unpacking
* Exporting randomized files back into a DAT or in a thpatch-compatible directory
